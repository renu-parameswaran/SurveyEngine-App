## Assignment- 1

Survey engine.

Assignment:

The aim of this assignment is to build a survey engine from scratch using vanilla JS. The survey engine will take an object with questions and options as input and 
show one question after the other with options after selecting the option. 

Product Requirements:

1. The survey engine can have an optional welcome and thank you screen.
2. The survey engine should read the config JSON provided and show questions and options. 
3. On selecting one of the options, the next question should be picked on the basis of conditions array, provided in the config JSON. 
4. For the sake of simplicity, we will be having only single selection questions. But use configurations in such a way that any type can be added later. 
5. -1 in condition indicates end of survey. You can show a generic thank you screen / custom one if provided in the config.
5. On completing the survey, console.log all the questions with options selected. 

Technical requirements:

1. Use vanillaJS to build this. You can use any vanillaJS boilerplate to get started, but do not add any other packages (except bundling essentials).
2. Use CSS for styles. 
3. Object oriented JS.
